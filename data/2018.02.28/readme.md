Contains all files generated for powerball drawing on: 02.28.2018

This is the first set of generated combinations that I am publishing.  I'm handling this on-the-fly
and have no expections.  I am publishing these results due to an anomaly spotted by on of the algorithms.
I'm pretty confident that the algorithm will be correct, so, I'm publishing to prove I generated the data
prior to the actual drawing.  The git repo will have the timestamp of the commit and that is not something
I can fake or manipulate and I don't want to.  I truly want this service to be honest, so, this is the best way
I can think of doing that today.

There are 6 models.  3 base and 3 drastically reduced models.  I'm very excited to know if the base
models will contain the winning combination minus the powerball.  There are 2 additional model types, however,
I'm not publishing those today as I don't think they will containing the winning combination.
